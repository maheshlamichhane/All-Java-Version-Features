Sealed Classes
-> Inheritance enables any class to inherit from any other class.
-> Making a class final prevents any class from inheriting from that class i.e the final class
cannot become a super type at all.
-> what if you wanted your class to be available for inheritance but only to certain classes?
-> Sealed classes enable us to control the scope of inheritance by enabling us to specify
a classes subtypes.
-> Also works with interfaces(we can define what classses implement the interface).
