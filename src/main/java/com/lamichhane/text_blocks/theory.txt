Text Blocks
-> A text block is a String object and as a result, shares the same properties as String objects
(immutable and interned).
    * you can call String methods on a text block

-> A text block begins with three double-quote characters followed by newline. i.e ""
    * text blocks cannot be put on one line
    * the text of a text block cannot follow the """
-> Example
String tbName = """
             SEAN KENNEDY""";

-> In String literals embedded quotes must be escaped. This is not the case with text blocks.
-> Depending on where you place the closing delimeter,determines whether or not you have a
closing.
