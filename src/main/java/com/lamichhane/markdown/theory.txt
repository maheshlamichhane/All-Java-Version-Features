Markdown
-> HTML is a powerful and standardised markup language consumed by web browsers since the
mid 90's.
-> However, as HTML is tedious to write and hard to read, it is much less popular as markup
manually produced by humans.
-> In addition, many new developers are not fluent in HTML.
-> Markdown is a popular markup language that is easy to read/write and easily transformed into
HTML.
-> Invented in 2004 by John Gruber what distinguishes Markdown from other lightweight markup
syntaxes, is its readability.
    * The overriding design goal for markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as readable as
    possible.
-> Gruber's canonical description of Markdowns syntax is not unambigious and has led to differing
output from various processors.
-> Conveniently, Markdown allows the use of HTML as well.
