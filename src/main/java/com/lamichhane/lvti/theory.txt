Local Variable Type Inference(LVTI)
-> Java is a strongly typed language i.e you must specify the type of a variable when
introducing it.
-> However since java 10, we have the option, in certain scenarios, of using the keyword var
instead of the type. In these situations, the compiler infers the type e.g var x = "abc";
-> Remember that the variables must be local and must be initialised on the line where they
are declared.
