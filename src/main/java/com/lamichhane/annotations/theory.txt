Annotations
-> Metadata is information about information.
-> Annotations, via metadata,enable us to add value to our code.
-> We can annotate to classes,methods variables etc.
-> Though options,when used they must be used correctly.
-> Annotations operate much like interfaces. In fact, their origins are in interfaces. Their
elements look like abstract methods. This will be clearer when we look at examples.
-> Annotation names are case sensitive;however, it is common practise to start the name with an
Uppercase letter.
-> Like interfaces, annotations can be applied to unrelated classes.

-> @Target limits the types that the annotation can be applied to.
-> The types are specified as an array of ElementType enum values.
