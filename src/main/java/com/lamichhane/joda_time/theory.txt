Joda Time API:
-> Joda-Time is an open-source Java library developed to provide a better, more consistent, and more user-friendly
date and time API than the older java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes.

Why Was Joda-Time Created?
Before Java 8 java.util.Date and Calendar were poorly designed.They were mutable, not thread-safe, and confusing
(e.g., months start at 0)

They lacked useful features like:
-> Formatting/parsing
-> Time zones handling

Duration calculations
So Joda-Time was created to:
-> Make date-time handling easier, clearer, and less error-prone
-> Add support for immutable, thread-safe, and fluent API design

Key Joda-Time Classes:

Class	            Purpose
DateTime	        Represents date and time
LocalDate	        Date without time
LocalTime	        Time without date
LocalDateTime	    Date + time, no timezone
Period	            Represents a duration in human terms
Duration	        Fixed duration in milliseconds
Interval	        Time interval with start & end
DateTimeZone	    Time zone handling
Formatter	        Formatting and parsing dates
