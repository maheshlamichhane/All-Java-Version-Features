What is a Functional Interface?
-> A Functional Interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. It can have any number of default
or static methods but only one abstract method.

Key Characteristics:
-> Marked with the @FunctionalInterface annotation (optional, but helps catch errors).
-> Can be used as the target type for a lambda expression or method reference.

@FunctionalInterface
interface Function {
    int apply(T a, T b);
}

Function add = (a, b) -> a + b;
System.out.println(add.apply(5, 3));  // Output: 8

What is BiFunction in Java?
-> BiFunction<T, U, R> is a predefined functional interface in Java (from the java.util.function package) that
represents a function which takes two arguments of types T and U and returns a result.
