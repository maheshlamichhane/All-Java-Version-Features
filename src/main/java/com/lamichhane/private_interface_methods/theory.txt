Private Interface methods:
-> Introduced in Java 9, interfaces can now have private methods.
-> These private methods can be both static and non-static.
-> As they are private, they are accessible within the interface only.
-> As with classes,you cannot access a non-static interface method from a static method.
-> They have two advantages:
i. reduce code duplication
ii. improve code encapsulation
