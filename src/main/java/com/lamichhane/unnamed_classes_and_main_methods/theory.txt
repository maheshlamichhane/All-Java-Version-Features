Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods:
-> Java supports both "programming in the small" (variables,methods,control flow etc...) and
"programming in the large" (classes,interfaces,packages,modules etc).
-> The goal is to focus on the "programming in the small" by reducing ceremony/scaffolding for
those learning the language.
-> Constructs such as classes, access modifiers such as public and keywords such as static
relate to "programming in large" and should only be encountered when required.
-> In effect, make Java easier to learn. To this end, JEP 445 enables learners to write their first
 programs without needing to understand language features designed for large programs.
 -> Basic programs in a concise manner.
 public class HelloWorld{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
 }

Instance Main Methods
class HelloWorld{
    void main(){
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
-> no need for static,public or a String[] parameters.
-> If you have both the traditional public static void main(String args[]) and the instance main(),
the traditional version takes precedence.


Unnamed Classes:
void main(){
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
}
-> Unnamed classes:
    * extend from Object and cannot implement an interface.
    * are final and reside in the unnamed package.
    * their .class name on the hard disk depends on the filename - for example, if the above
    code is in HelloWorld.java,HelloWorld.class is create on the hard disk.
    * are exactly like normal classes except that an unnamed class has only one constructor -
    the default no-args constructor provided by the compiler.
    * it is an error to explicitly code a constructor, even a no-args constructor.
    * the this keyword is still valid.
    * as a code cannot refer to an unnamed class by name,instance of an unnamed class cannot be
    constructed directly.
    * therefore such classes are useful for standalone programs or as an entry-point to a program.
    * as a result, unnamed classes must have a main() method.
