Unnamed variables and patterns:
-> Unnamed variables and unnamed patterns were introduced in java 21 and finalised in java 22.
-> Both are denoted with the underscore character.
-> The goal here is that in situations where variables are declared with no intention to use
them, we can now make the intent of their non-use explicit.
-> This makes the code cleaner,more readable and more maintainable.
-> Unnamed variables apply to local variables:
    * local variable declarations
    * headers in basic/enhanced for loops
    * try with resources
    * exception parameters in catch clauses
    * lambda parameters in lambda expressions.
-> Unnamed variable do not apply to instance variables.
-> Declaring a variable that is never used is very common in code whoose side effect is very
important.
